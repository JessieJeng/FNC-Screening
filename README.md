This R package implements an effective method to retain weak signals through false negative control.  

This method can select a set of candidate variables to retain a high proportion of signals, even when the signals are not individually separable from noise. The method is built upon efficient regulation of the proportion of false negatives at a user-specified level in realistic settings with arbitrary covariance dependence between variables.
